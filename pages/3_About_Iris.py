slt.text("The Iris dataset, also known as the Fisher's Iris dataset, is one of the most famous and widely used datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 as part of his paper (The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems.) The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, evenly distributed across three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.")
slt.text("The Iris dataset holds historical and educational significance as one of the earliest examples of multivariate data analysis. It is often used as a beginnerâ€™s dataset for exploring concepts in classification, clustering, and data visualization, making it a foundational resource in both academic instruction and the development of new algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the dataset captures important real-world characteristics such as class overlap and feature correlation, providing a compact and effective platform for learning fundamental techniques in machine learning and data science.")
